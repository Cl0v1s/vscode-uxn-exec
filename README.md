# vscode-uxn-exec

vscode-uxn-exec is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to assemble and run [UXN](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html) (UxnTal) code in real time. 
UXN is a virtual stack-based computer with a unique set of assembly instructions, designed for creative coding and interactive art. With this extension, you can streamline your UXN development workflow directly within Visual Studio Code.

Yup, I know that using vscode and all that electron stuff is quiet against the principles behind the whole uxn project. BUT I need some tools to be able to play 
with the language when I'm on the road with only my tablet (and it's extensive battery life), so here we are.

## Features

- Assemble and run UXN code in real time.
- Easily execute your UXN code from within Visual Studio Code.
- Supports convenient keyboard shortcuts for quick execution.

## Usage

1. Open a `.uxn` file in Visual Studio Code.
2. Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
3. Type `Run UXN` and select it from the dropdown list.

The extension will assemble and run the UXN code in your file, providing immediate feedback on the output.
